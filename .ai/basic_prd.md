# AllWorkouts – MVP Concept

## Goal
AllWorkouts helps users easily manage and track strength training programs.
The app lets users **paste text-based workout plans**, which AI converts into a structured format, and **log their actual workout performance** (weights, sets, reps).

## Core MVP Features

### 1. AI Plan Import
Users can paste a workout plan (e.g., copied from a blog or PDF).
AI converts it into a structured plan organized by training days and exercises.

### 2. Workout Logging
Users can record their training results for each exercise — weight used, sets, and reps completed.

### 3. Workout History
Users can view a simple list of completed sessions to track adherence over time.

## Out of MVP Scope
- Exercise substitution based on available equipment
- Advanced analytics or progress charts
- Social or sharing features
- AI-generated workout plans from scratch
- Mobile app or offline mode

These may be added in future versions.
